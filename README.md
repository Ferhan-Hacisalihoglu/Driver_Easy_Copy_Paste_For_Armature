This Blender script mirrors animation drivers from the left side (L) to the right side (R) for an armature. 
It identifies existing drivers related to left-side bones, duplicates them, and adjusts the targets and paths to match the right side. This helps to automate the process of creating mirrored animation setups in character rigs.

"Usage:"
    -The script works on an armature named "Armature".
    -It copies drivers related to rotation and adjusts variables for mirrored bone movements.
